			"content": "Aww, almost got away with it! This has been a highly requested feature in the previous ticket around this. We initially said no to this request for the following reasons :The scenario you purposed could very well be true, that people go like \"its green\" so its good - while you want to trigger \"I can make it greener\". But so could the scenario \"it's not really green at all, lemme fill it up\" its kind of something we should test rather then just assume one scenario. About adding description, it could definitely help for accessibility and maybe also people who don't really take the time to associate colour and just read and click submit. But I am not sure how we could place that in the interface and whether or not it really triggers those folks - to avoid adding even more clutter we should really think about this one)To many people it sounded as an obvious solution, so it might be weird that we initially decided against it. But you have to consider that sometimes what big other sites do, might not work for people using Drupal.",

			"content": "So I want to clarify something as someone who was there witnessing poor users struggle with the password checker at U of M.The problem wasn't the colour taking focus away from the fact that passwords didn't match. The problem was the *proportion* of the coloured big ugly box related to other things in the form, and how it magically popped out of nowhere:If you really want to make the password match status more visible, stick a little checkmark/stop sign logo next to it like we have in admin/reports/status. But I think that might clutter the form unnecessarily. The colour is diminished here already because the area the colour takes up is MUCH smaller than it was before.Here's why I filed this issue, and a summary of my arguments \"pro\" this:\n* I got hung up here for a good 30 seconds or so thinking there was a bug. Since this was confusing for me -- I'm a user of Drupal too :P -- it's likely going to be confusing for others as well. alpritt pointed out though that I'm not exactly a \"typical\" user of Drupal, which might be true, but people who use Drupal every day are *also* our target market, remember. ;)\n* yoroy pointed out that red is wrong because red means \"stop\" \"error condition\" etc. However, green is normally a colour that means \"Yay! everything is great!\" and in NO way is \"a\" a great password. :P\n* Furthermore, this green bar is not a check for \"did someone fill in the form\" (otherwise we'd have green bars next to ALL of our required fields), it is an indicator for the strength of the password. And in terms of password strength, \"a\" *is* an error condition: it's horribly insecure.\n\n* Every dynamic password checker I can remember using on any site does it the way Google does it. Jakob Nielsen points out that other people use other sites more than yours, so I'm not sure why we're not conforming to user expectations here.\n* Bojhan pointed out that the above wan't true; Yahoo! does not use colour this way. However, it uses four separate rectangles to indicate the \"how far along are you\" which tells me there are 4 steps to secure passwords. Ours is just a bar along a single continuum so the correlation is not a direct match.I think those were all the major points from our discussion.",

			"content": "@webchick:My point was not that you are a highly experienced user of Drupal, but more that you have been involved in this specific issue. So you fall on the developer rather than user side, and so are more likely to be looking for problems. So, yes, there may be an issue here; but there is not necessarily one. We need to test against naive users to get a proper understanding.I took a look at a couple of dozen password checkers before designing the current implementation. The current design is a lot closer to the norm, than what we had before. But as for getting closer to it, I'm not sure we can because there is really not a consistent design between them. So, at this more subtle stage, I again think we really need to test. I could argue the merits for the change either way.Another option may be to go from grey to green.",

			"content": "I think you meant green to grey. :) If so, I think that would definitely help. If the bar had been purple or grey or polkadots I don't think my brain would've triggered the \"wtf?\" It was the fact that green == OK that messed me up.Could we talk about that in a separate issue though, since this one is about colourizing them?I agree that I'm too close to the issue, and that the way to figure out the way forward is with actual user testing. So if someone rolls a patch for this and we get it committed, we can get two groups of users: one testing UNSTABLE-X (2 or 3 or whatever has the old behaviour) and one testing HEAD with the new way, and take notes on who was least confused. :D",

Gotta stop doing that.I'm glad that you went back to the color scheme in #11. The \"red-yellow-green\" metaphor to traffic signals is clean and works well for everyone who can distinguish those colors, regardless of whether they can see the true hues. The text is essential, so it's fantastic that it's there.Here's my original post, which I won't edit because it makes other strong and valid points:\nReading through this thread, I see that the verdict on color has gone back and forth. I have a lot more confidence in sites that use color and text to encourage me to develop a strong password. I'll bet most other Web users do, too.The text is essential. The color is an enhancement. One caveat: If color is used, check it with one of the many free color contrast analysis tools available online. If used as a background, make sure it is light enough that it doesn't reduce the contrast ratio with the text below 4.5:1 ? preferably closer to 7:1. (In these patches, the text seems to be running small.) And if the color is used for text, be sure that it is dark enough that its contrast ratio to the background is in that same range.Otherwise, a lot of us will be relying on screen readers to operate this interface. (Oh, by the way ? because the color is an enhancement, Everett's idea of making sure it can be turned off is a good one. Ideally, not only any themer but also anyone who manages a site should be able to flip that switch.)",

Here are a couple of plausible misinterpretations:So the implication of the change in size is the opposite of the implication of the change in color ? at least it is until we get to green.Here's another way of thinking about it:I see only one drawback to making all signals the same size: The user would not get the idea that a password with a strength factor of 85 is not quite as good as a password with a strength factor of 100. If that troubles you, I suggest we just keep the bar yellow at 85. For it to turn green, the strength factor would have to reach 100 (or whatever other value you consider prudent).",

In fact we were closer in the beginning of this patch to existing conventionshttp://drupal.org/files/issues/password-strength-meter.pngSomehow we tried to make the progress bar \"small\", and fit the text together.

As I said before, the analogy to traffic signals is understood everywhere there is enough traffic to have signals ? and many places where there isn't, because railroads use the same convention.If having four colors will get this done, then, fine, let's have four colors. But I don't understand why you've decided that I and others involved in this discussion have no concern for \"the Drupal brand.\"If the Drupal brand was so important to you, why did you wait until just four days ago to bring it up ? comment #76 ? when this issue has been around for over 10 months? I really would have been happy to consider that point, and I'm sure others would have been, too.It's not that we don't care. It's just that we hadn't thought about it from that perspective. Had the suggestion come up earlier, perhaps one of us would have thought of a way to make the Druplicon look weak, fair, pretty good, and then as strong as Superman, and Mike could have written code to support that model. And maybe the result would have worked for all of us ? and maybe not, but at least we could have had the discussion (and Mike would have had more of an opportunity to respond to your request).Please, in the future, if something really does matter to you, get it out into the discussion early. Don't ambush the rest of us with a new thought at the end.",

			"content": "Cliff: comment #2 by bojhan makes similar points. It's not an ambush. Bojhan speaks from experience in seeing people *stumble only a little bit* over the password checker during usability tests. Most of this was fixed in another issue, explicitly leaving the colors out of the discussion because they don't really matter that much in the total of this specific interaction. Then this issue got created and look here, we're almost 100 comments in, talking about which color to paint the bikeshed. Sure, with accessability improvements committed along the way, but still going on about picking colors.What we're trying to argue here is that we should try and make our own choices, *not* copy google or others because the context in which this interaction happens is so different. Here it's part of a much longer installation process, most other examples given here are part of a much shorter and simpler signup. I guess Bojhan's last comment was cynical in the sense of \"if we don't dare to make our own informed choices, then be sure to go all the way in copying\".It's fixing things that are not broken. See #83, which is feedback from actual usage for example. It's just frustrating to see so much energy being put into what's mostly a non-isssue based on assumptions rather then actual usability testing.And I guess it's equally hard to tell who's who and who knows what they are talking about from just reading comments, but yeah, that's the issue queue for ya.",

			"content": "@yoroy and @Bojhan: Perhaps one day we can swap stories and share a few laughs over an appropriate beverage. I hope so. Still, I stand by my earlier comments. In #2, Bojhan does not mention anything about Drupal branding. Not even a hint. And to the extent that he's expressing concern about the usability test results, I think webchick in #3 quite clearly refuted his notion that the use of color was the actual source of the problem.I, for one, have never seen Google's password checker. Everything I contributed came from the experience and professional judgment I've developed in years of Web design, Web redesign (!), and usability testing. So, although the \"red-yellow-green\" color scheme might not have been creative or even original, it would have been effective, and the suggestion that those who participated in this issue simply aped Google was completely out of line.The well-designed small patch of red in the recent patches is a far cry from the big, ugly, obtrusive, and, coincidentally, red error message that triggered the problems in the usability test. I agree wholeheartedly with the point I hear from webchick in #3: It's important to incorporate testing by potential users into the design process, but it's even more important to be sure we identify and fix the actual source of each significant problem that process identifies.In this case, the right answer was to replace something that was big, ugly, and obtrusive with something elegant ? not to get rid of the color.",

That will keep things simple and familiar.Unless someone wants to come up with five different versions of the Druplicon, ranging from anemic to robustly healthy, to use in place of a progress bar, and can do so in less than three weeks, I don't see a way of making everyone happy.",
